# Overview

This is a group for anyone in the Bay Area who’s interested in cognitive science.

Our plan is devilishly simple:

1. Pick a book or paper related to the field
2. Read it
3. Meet to discuss it - hopefully in real life, somewhere central San Francisco.

All are welcome, and in order to keep it this way we will probably steer away from expert academic literature and be pitched a little more towards enthusiastic amateurs. But let’s see how it goes.

If you'd like to propose something to read, please add it (and/or upvote existing suggestions) to [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UtA_ONDgMsVSo0eaIZjvJbJ0c5TfmTFYTscC1x9B7BI/edit#gid=0).
