We discussed The Experience Machine by Andy Clark

### Tom’s notes:

Arnie - MIT lab 1970s with Minsky, Pappert. Then NASA. The Mystery Spot, Santa Cruz
J: predictive processing seems counterintuitive; intuitively perception seems direct. Persuasive rationales:
  Top-down wiring in the brain
  Information transmission efficiently
J: Book could use some more experimental references justifying it
S: His talks go into details of experiments - especially sound-related ones. Also explains visual illusions
T: could provide an evolutionary advantage in terms of competition?
J: Speed of reaction or action might do this too
S: Fight or flight is a core reaction
T: Cost of a false positive is less than the cost of a false negative
F: Something I’d like to consider in my own life

T: He makes a stronger link between perception and action than in previous books - action as a mechanism to remove prediction error.
S: Yes, like a dog move its ears to listen…
J: P71 quote about unifying action and prediction
A: But you have to distort what prediction means to do this - is it a prediction or a goal?
A: more of a syntactic critique than a theoretical one
T: I felt the precision-estimator side of things was a bit of a homunculus

S: You wouldn’t normally act before deciding what it is you’re seeing
F: The book talks about biases in societal perception
J: Is it fair to say “my goal is to drink” and predictive processing is a lower-level thing around guiding the action?
T: homeostasis: you drink because you want to minimize future dehydration… evidence being that you stop feeling thirsty when you drink, not when the fluid reaches your body.
S: System 1 and System 2?
T: Clark seems to try and unify them into a single account…
F: In LLMs, when you tell a LLM to do a task, or do it with chain-of-thought, it does better.

F: some disorders of the mind come from a locked-in model
A: very interested in his explanations of autism and schizophrenia
J: he talks about chronic pain - easier to understand - and depression - which fits with CBT ideas of depression, you’re stuck predicting the future wrongly.
A: his theory is that autistic people rate sensory information higher than their hypotheses… but he tests it by comparing to how regular people see Moody figures differently to autistic - and it’s the same. So they can’t be under weighing the hypothesis, they must be overweighting the sensory data.
J: is it a net-zero thing?
S: autistic friends lack social context…
T: I’m stuck on Arnie’s zero-sum critique…
J: Schizophrenia involves mistaken generation of highly weighted prediction errors
A: he says that somehow schizophrenics do this, I don’t get it.
S: we generate predictions in the mind while dreaming… do schizophrenics do this when awake, seeing threats?
A: in dreams, you don’t pay any attention to error signals. All kinds of things happen without bothering you…
S: If you look at how nerve cells form in a brain, it’s in columns. Schizophreniac nerve endings go in all sorts of directions, 
T: This would be sources of more error, rather than stronger predictions?
F: I’ve heard that hypersensitive people have more neuronal connections - insufficiently pruned? 
J: It often develops at a time of life when there’s final pruning in the brain.
J: strangeness in schizophrenic experience suggests unintended prediction errors.
A: so you hear a voice, you’re overweighting your expectations.
F: in delusional people, the brain is looking for evidence of radical hypotheses
S: For PTSD sufferers, it’s similarly overweighted - someone with shell shock hears a window slam and panics
J: This theory doesn’t explain why a schizophrenic person’s delusions are so often paranoid.
T: could confer a survival advantage - overperception of threats?
S: not as social creatures though. Is it about stronger connection to the limbic system - areas we don’t use during cognition? Stronger internal connections.
A: feels to me that schizophrenics overweight prediction, not prediction error.
J: psychosis goes in one direction: you’re Jesus Christ, or you caused an earthquake, and reject evidence to the contrary.

T: As someone working in this area, how convincing did you find this chapter?
J: I would often ask people to do experiments that disprove their own errors.
S: Humans have more inputs than animals
T: The example he gives about perceptions of dentist affecting perception of pain
F: I used strong stimuli after an operation to modify my pain perception and avoid the use of opiates

J: there’s a condition where people who lose their vision in old age hallucinate
A: Go to flotation tanks!
T: Oliver Sacks book, Musicophilia, has examples of musical hallucinations
A: Predictive processing should have a solution here

J: Aesthetic chills. Clark talks about a device to produce these.
T: I find I get these with music, but the first few times I hear a song
J: I guess we enjoy music in a way that animals don’t. Finely tuned pitch detectors? I have a book, Sweet Anticipation, a psychologists account of music: the doling out of surprise.
S: Often it’s harmonies or where music is predictable. Music patterns and wave patterns align?
J: Music pop music has an enjoyable cadential pattern 
A: isn’t much more interesting if it’s more surprising?
J: It’s a like a recipe and hot sauce - too little surprise and it’s bland, too much and it’s inedible
A: aren’t we seeking novelty?
T: Is this Friston’s free energy principle?
A: Friston invented all this, Clark explains it
(Digression about Friston)
S: Minimizing risk is important for beings - music is informed by our minds trying to reach a point where you understand where you are.


T: Clark talks about novelty-seeking as being improving ones self-predictions. So you need novelty to do this - can’t be done in a dark room.
A: Species without curiosity don’t last long.
T: Challenge: some organisms don’t need this (bacteria). What’s different about the ones that do?
J: does the idea of curiosity being adaptive apply across the board, or do you need a level of behavioral complexity for it to pay off?
A: Anything that has sexual selection has a bell-curve of traits, lots of variability - this is exploration. Need to look at it at a population level.
S: Differs by species. Mice are paranoid. Chimpanzees are curious when unintimidated.
J: anxious moods inhibits exploration, you retreat to safety. Less anxious mice are more inclined to explore

T: chapter 5 on qualia, relating predictive states to qualia and drawing a connection.
J: Found this insufficient to explain the qualia
A: In the chapter he didn’t deal with the hard problem
F: p120 he takes the side of Dennett. Qualia aren’t real but seem to be - but then seeming is the whole problem! The Guinness problem - your ascription of a quality to  a thing makes it a self-fulfilling property.
S: a cockroach is born with 150k genes and is preprogrammed with all it needs
T: Bees seem to have learned behavior, pain avoidance.
J: Language is a good example - brains are wired when young, Infants can detect a wider range of consonants when you’re born.
S: This goes back to the process of pruning in schizophrenia
A: e.g. Japanese lack of distinction being l and r

F: what about the final chapter on hacking?
T: Placebo effects, etc.
F: Not all conditions respond to placebo  - e.g OCD doesn’t, depression does
S: Goes back to the self-model…

F: also v interested in the connection between the brain and the cut
F: Would like to find some brain/gut materials
J: “The body has a mind of its own” is a relevant book
A: On extended mind, people with dementia enrolling their environment into their mind
S: Sadhu’s in India - control of systems, heart-beat, etc.
