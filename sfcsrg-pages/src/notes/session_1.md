# Session 1: "Being You"

## March 7 2023 @ Rowzzy Labs
## Attendees: Dylan, Tom, David, Jose, Iris
### Tom’s notes
We all had trouble with Karl Friston
Is predictive coding the same thing as Free Energy Principle?
Jose: concern with questions over materialism in early chapters
Karl Popper talks about places where you can get emergent phenomena
Unpredictability of life emerging
Stewart Koffman - cells change their environment, so we're constantly changing our possibilities.
All atoms contain an event horizon (Dylan)
Brian Cox, media punditry vs research
The relationship between Lempel-viz Compression and Integrated Information Theory ?
Materialism to physicalism to functionalism (Tom didn’t get the differences)
Donald Hoffman and controlled hallucination
Anaesthetics. During sleep the Thalamus is disconnected from the brain. Thalamus is thus potentially the seat of consciousness?
Understanding mechanisms of anaesthesia as a route to understanding consciousness
Seth’s examination of IIT doesn't cover recent work on memory storage in hippocampus
 Hippocampus replaying "ripples" of memories when going to sleep

Book and paper recommendations:

The Predictive Mind, Jacob Hohwy (Dave)
The Growth of Biological Thought, Ernst Meyer
Do No Harm, Henry Marsh (Tom)
Designing with the Mind in Mind (Iris)

How the meeting went, thoughts for the next one:

Jose likes this level of detail for reading
Dylan interested in plotting all scientists, understanding relationships between their work.
David: wondering whether a book-length thing is right, or an accessible survey papers? Josh Tenenbaum, Samuel Gershwin?
Iris: keener for a shorter read; maybe something to summarize easily and a book?
We might alternate book and paper, to give more time for reading the former and let us go deep on a topic. (General agreement)
David: try pulling out a basket of topics we identify at the beginning
Dylan: Outline the concepts around consciousness - emergence?
Tom: map out the area and create a historical doc with recommendations etc
Jose: schizophrenia and psychosis as a follow-up?
Stanislav Dehan
Meet in ~a month (Tom can’t do earlier)
Need a follow-up survey (Tom)
